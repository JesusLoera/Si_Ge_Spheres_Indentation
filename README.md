# Si_Ge_Spheres_Indentation
I am a member of the Molecular Design Lab at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Leon and we have studied the mechanical properties of silicon germanium nanospheres. In this repository you can find the LAMMPS and Python scripts that we have used for simulate and analyze the compression of a nanoparticle by a planar indenter.
