# Gifs of simulated indentations

We have rendered gifs to visualize the indentation process of the 
nanoparticles and the internal structure of the spheres by assigning a 
color for each atom based on its coordination number.

For the coordination analysis

- Green: Coordination number = 4
- Orange: Coordination number = 5
- Red: Coordination number = 6
