Several visualizations have been created to calculate elastic properties
of the nanospheres and to understand the internal hardening mechanism.

In this folder you can find the following types of graphs.

- Force-displacement curves
- Stress-strain curves
- Internal energy as a function of strain
- Fraction of atoms by coordination number as a function of strain
- Calculation of stiffness for each nanosphere
- Calculation of hardness for each nanosphere
- Correlation of force with correlation number
